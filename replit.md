## System Architecture

### Full-Stack Structure

The project uses a **monorepo layout** with three main areas:

- `client/` — React frontend (Vite, TypeScript)
- `server/` — Express backend (Node.js, TypeScript)
- `shared/` — Shared types, DB schema, and route definitions used by both client and server

This shared layer prevents duplication and keeps API contracts in sync between frontend and backend.

### Frontend Architecture

- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript, bundled by Vite
- **Routing**: Wouter (lightweight alternative to React Router) — note: Wouter `<Link>` must NOT wrap `<a>` tags directly
- **State Management**: Zustand with `persist` middleware for the shopping cart (survives page refresh via localStorage)
- **Server State**: TanStack React Query for all API data fetching, mutations, and cache invalidation
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui (New York style) built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with a custom dark "high-tech" theme (deep navy background, vibrant cyan primary color)
- **Fonts**: Inter (body) and Outfit (display/headings), loaded from Google Fonts
- **SEO**: react-helmet-async for dynamic `<head>` management per page
- **Forms**: react-hook-form with Zod resolvers for validation

### Backend Architecture

- **Framework**: Express 5 (with TypeScript via tsx in dev)
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Storage layer**: `DatabaseStorage` class implementing the `IStorage` interface (defined in `server/storage.ts`) — all DB access goes through this interface
- **Routes**: Registered in `server/routes.ts`, paths/schemas defined in `shared/routes.ts`
- **Dev server**: Vite middleware is integrated into the Express server in development for HMR
- **Production build**: esbuild bundles the server; Vite builds the client into `dist/public/`

### Shared API Contract (`shared/routes.ts`)

A centralized `api` object defines every endpoint's method, path, Zod input schema, and response schemas. Both the server (for validation) and client hooks (for typed fetching and response parsing) consume this same object. A `buildUrl()` helper handles path param substitution.

### Database Schema (`shared/schema.ts`)

Four tables in PostgreSQL via Drizzle:

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `products` | Items for sale (name, description, price, category, subcategory, imageUrl, compatibleModels) |
| `customers` | Customer records created at checkout |
| `orders` | Order records linked to a customer, with status and total |
| `order_items` | Line items linking orders to products with quantity and price snapshot |

`products` has two extra columns:
- `subcategory` (text, nullable): e.g. `screen-protectors`, `cases`, `chargers`
- `compatible_models` (text[], nullable): list of device models the product fits (e.g. all iPhone 8–17 variants for screen protectors)

Zod schemas are auto-generated from the Drizzle table definitions using `drizzle-zod`.

### Routing (Pages)

### Navigation Features

- **URL deep-linking**: eShop supports `?tab=mobile&brand=Samsung` URL params for direct navigation from mega-menu

### Cart Flow

1. User browses eShop → clicks "Add to cart" → Zustand store updates
2. Cart drawer slides in (Sheet component) showing items
3. User goes to `/checkout`, fills in name/email/phone/address
4. On submit, `useCheckout` mutation POSTs to `/api/orders/create` with customer info + cart items
5. Server creates/finds customer, creates order + order items in a transaction
6. Cart is cleared on success
